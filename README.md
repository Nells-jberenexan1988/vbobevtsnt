Dude, I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 Kimge kereksin and man, I'm both hyped and a tad confused. Like, you ever 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 something that feels like it's trying to hug you and slap you all at once? That's how it was. The main character, such a mess but like... in a relatable way, you know? Seriously, I felt like half the time I found myself going yeah, I've been there, or at least feeling like I've been there. Maybe just in my dreams lol.

But can we talk about the soundtrack? Holy shiz, that music hit right in the feels. I swear I just wanted to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   just for the tracks. Whoever did the sound design deserves a medal or a cake or something, cause 👏👏👏. 

> And, like, the twists? Ok, so no spoilers, but at one point I legit yelled at my screen. If anyone heard me, they’d probably think I’ve lost it. Idk, man, it's just wild how invested you get, right? It's like one minute you’re chilling and the next you’re living through it all. 

Plot-wise, sometimes I was like, wait, really? But in a good way. It's messy but who isn’t? I mean, let’s be real, show me a   without some random messy bits, and I'll show you a liar, lol. Anyway, it made me wanna grab a coffee and just sit down and 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again to catch things I missed originally. You ever have those moments where you’re like, “how did I miss that?”

By the end, I felt kinda drained but in a weirdly satisfied way, if that makes sense? It’s like binge-𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a whole series and then needing to sleep for a week. Thought it would be a chill ride but nah, it got me right in the brain. Anyway, do you think we'll ever see something like that go main𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮 or is it gonna stay indie forever? 

int main() { return 0; }

Oh, and speaking of randomness, did you see what was trending today? People are wild on social media lately!
